# Complete Todo
_Yet another todo application, but under the simple functionality is not the easiest implementation :)_

This project is a consistence of all my actual skills for March 2021.
It has been written, using **M**ongoDB, **E**xpress, **R**eact (with TypeScript) and **N**odeJS.
Also, you can check server's [package.json](https://github.com/DonAlexandro/complete-todo/blob/master/package.json)
and client's [one](https://github.com/DonAlexandro/complete-todo/blob/master/client/package.json) to see lists of other packages, that I used in this app.

### Available scripts

#### `npm run start`
Builds the app once. Useful, when there is a need to launch app on a real host

#### `npm run serve`
Starts the development server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

#### `npm run client`
Runs the client development scripts

#### `npm run client:build`
Runs the client production scripts

#### `npm run client:install`
Installs all dependencies for a client

#### `npm run dev`
Starts both the server, and the client at one time on a [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), using [concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently)
